This version keeps everything professional and focuses on the technical decisions that make this a "Security Project" rather than just a simple script. It highlights your understanding of threat models and cryptographic standards.

##Python Secure Vault (AES-256-GCM)
Implementation of Modern Cryptographic Standards for Local Credential Storage

This project is a local password manager built to demonstrate the practical application of industry-standard cryptography. The vault follows a Zero-Knowledge architecture, ensuring that the user's master password is never stored and the data remains encrypted even if the database file is compromised.

##Security Architecture
1. Key Derivation (Argon2id)
To transform the master password into a 256-bit encryption key, I implemented Argon2id.

Brute-Force Resistance: Unlike standard SHA-256 or PBKDF2, Argon2id is "memory-hard."

Configuration: Configured with a 64MB memory cost, making it significantly more difficult for attackers to use specialized hardware (ASICs) or high-end GPUs to perform offline brute-force attacks.

2. Authenticated Encryption (AES-256-GCM)
For data encryption, the vault uses AES-256 in GCM (Galois/Counter Mode).

Confidentiality + Integrity: GCM is an "Authenticated Encryption" mode. Every entry produces an Authentication Tag.

Tamper Protection: If the database file is modified (bit-flipping or unauthorized edits), the decryption process will detect the mismatch and fail automatically, ensuring data integrity.

3. Database & Forensic Security
Zero-Knowledge Storage: The master password is used solely for key derivation in volatile memory (RAM). Verification is handled through an encrypted "canary" value.

Forensic Prevention: The implementation utilizes the SQLite VACUUM command. This ensures that when a record is deleted, the data is physically overwritten and purged from the storage sector rather than just being marked as "empty space."

##Technical Stack
Language: Python 3.10+

Cryptography: cryptography.io (Hazmat layer for AES-GCM and Argon2)

Database: SQLite3 for persistent storage

Randomness: secrets module (CSPRNG - Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator)

UI Helpers: pyperclip for secure clipboard handling

##Installation & Usage

Install dependencies:

Bash
pip install cryptography pyperclip

Run the application:

Bash
python password.py
Initialization: On the first run, the system will prompt you to create a Master Password. 
Note: Due to the Zero-Knowledge nature of this app, there is no "Forgot Password" feature.
